# Fix for Render HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) Error

## Problem Summary
Your WKI Service Management App was receiving HTTP 429 errors from Render health checks because:

1. **Health check endpoints were subject to rate limiting** - Render's health checks (every 5 seconds) were hitting your rate-limited endpoints
2. **Rate limits were too restrictive** - Only 30 API requests per minute and 100 general requests per 15 minutes
3. **No health check configuration** - Default Render settings were checking too frequently

## Root Cause
```
Health checks every 5 seconds = 12 checks/minute
Rate limit: 100 requests per 15 minutes = ~6.67 requests/minute
Result: Health checks alone exceeded rate limits → 429 errors → Service marked as unhealthy
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Server Configuration (`backend/src/server.js`)
**CRITICAL FIX**: Moved health check endpoints BEFORE rate limiting middleware

**Before:**
```javascript
app.use('/api/', rateLimiters.api);
app.use(rateLimiters.general);
// ... then health checks
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Health checks FIRST (no rate limiting)
app.get('/health', ...)
app.get('/ready', ...)
app.get('/live', ...)
app.get('/metrics', ...)

// THEN apply rate limiting
app.use('/api/', rateLimiters.api);
app.use(rateLimiters.general);
```

### 2. Rate Limiting Configuration (`backend/src/middleware/security.js`)
Increased rate limits for production use:

| Limiter | Before | After | Reasoning |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| General | 100/15min | 500/15min | More headroom for normal traffic |
| API | 30/min | 100/min | Handle PDF uploads and data fetching |
| Auth | 5/15min | 10/15min | Slightly more forgiving for login attempts |

### 3. Render Configuration (`backend/render.yaml`)
Added health check tuning parameters:

```yaml
healthCheckPath: /health
healthCheckIntervalSeconds: 30      # Check every 30 seconds (was 5)
healthCheckTimeoutSeconds: 10       # 10 second timeout
healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds: 60   # Wait 60 seconds after deploy
```

**Impact:**
- Reduces health check frequency from 12/min to 2/min (83% reduction)
- Gives services more time to stabilize after deployment
- Reduces log noise

## Health Check Endpoints

Your app now has multiple health check endpoints:

1. **`/health`** (Primary) - Comprehensive health check with MongoDB status
   - Used by Render for monitoring
   - Returns 200 (OK/DEGRADED) or 503 (ERROR)
   - Includes uptime, memory, database status

2. **`/ready`** - Readiness probe
   - Checks if MongoDB is ready
   - Returns 200 (ready) or 503 (not ready)

3. **`/live`** - Liveness probe
   - Simple check that server is running
   - Always returns 200 if server is alive

4. **`/metrics`** - Performance metrics
   - Memory usage, CPU, database status
   - For monitoring and debugging

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Test rapid requests (should not get rate limited)
for i in {1..20}; do curl http://localhost:5000/health; done
```

### After Deployment to Render
1. Check Render dashboard - 429 errors should stop
2. Monitor logs - health checks should show 200 status codes
3. Verify uptime - service should stay healthy

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Commit all changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve 429 errors by exempting health checks from rate limiting"
git push origin main
```

2. **Render will auto-deploy** (if `autoDeploy: true`)
   - Or manually trigger deploy in Render dashboard

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Check Render logs for successful startup
   - Verify health checks return 200
   - Confirm no more 429 error emails

## Expected Results

✅ **No more 429 errors** from health checks  
✅ **Stable service uptime** without false failures  
✅ **Reduced log noise** from health check spam  
✅ **Better user experience** with higher rate limits  
✅ **More reliable monitoring** with proper health check intervals  

## Monitoring

Watch for these in Render logs:
```
✅ GOOD: GET /health - 200 - 2ms
✅ GOOD: MongoDB readyState: 1

❌ BAD (before fix): GET /health - 429 - Too Many Requests
```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Set up Render Alerts
Configure Render to only alert for:
- Multiple consecutive health check failures
- Memory/CPU thresholds exceeded
- Database connection issues

### 2. Consider Upgrading Render Plan
If you still experience issues:
- Upgrade from Starter to Standard plan
- Add more instances for high availability
- Enable auto-scaling

### 3. MongoDB Connection Monitoring
Monitor `mongoose.connection.readyState`:
- 0: Disconnected
- 1: Connected ✅
- 2: Connecting
- 3: Disconnecting

### 4. Future Improvements
- Add response time metrics
- Set up external uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- Implement database connection pooling
- Add caching layer (Redis) for frequently accessed data

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get 429 errors:
1. Check Render dashboard for actual request volume
2. Review rate limiter settings in `security.js`
3. Confirm health check path is `/health` not `/api/health`
4. Verify `trust proxy: 1` is set correctly

### If health checks fail (503):
1. Check MongoDB connection string in Render environment variables
2. Verify database is running and accessible
3. Check memory usage isn't exceeding limits
4. Review application logs for errors
